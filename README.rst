What it is
==========

SimShop is a tool that makes running command line based Verilog simulations
simple. It is used to organize and manage the files associated with Verilog
simulations and removes some of the more annoying aspects of testbench
management.

The source is open to use and/or modify by anyone, and is released under the
BSD license.

What it is not
==============

It is **not** a Verilog simulator like VCS, Modelsim or Icarus.
